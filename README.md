# OpenRent Redesign

Hello! Here's my alternative design to this page [https://www.openrent.co.uk/properties-to-rent/london?term=London].

There are some minor tweaks/ideas I had for the initial design but I wanted to try and imagine a completely different look than the original to showcase my ability. This design includes most of the features of the original page.

Some considerations:

* I wanted to implement the map component as well to showcase what the would look like with this design but that would take a little longer to build.
* Another different approach than the original design of the page that I wanted to go with was having the details of the property show up as a dialog/modal on click instead of navigating to a different page.
* Hope you enjoy those great AI generated photos of properties!
